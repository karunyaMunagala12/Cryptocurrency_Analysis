# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. This project involves the analysis of different types of cryptocurrencies over various years using historical price data.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of individual CSV files, each representing a different cryptocurrency. It includes daily price history starting from April 28, 2013. The dataset contains the following columns:

- **DATE**: The date of observations.
- **OPEN**: The opening price on the given day.
- **HIGH**: The highest price on the given day.
- **LOW**: The lowest price on the given day.
- **CLOSE**: The closing price on the given day.
- **VOLUME**: The volume of transactions on the given day.
- **MARKET CAP**: The market capitalization in USD.

## Insights to be Found

The analysis aims to discover various insights, including:

1. **Final Close Price**: Determining the closing price of cryptocurrencies.
2. **Highest Close Price**: Identifying the highest closing price.
3. **Lowest Close Price**: Identifying the lowest closing price.
4. **Average Daily Volume**: Calculating the average daily trading volume.
5. **Comparison of Close Price**: Comparing the closing prices within selected time frames.
6. **Price Comparison Table**: Creating a table comparing various cryptocurrencies.
7. **Best and Worst Performers**: Identifying the best and worst performers in the last 30 days and 365 days.
8. **Price Correlation**: Analyzing the price correlation between different cryptocurrencies.

## Key Observations

### Market Capitalization

Here are some key observations based on the analysis:

- Bitcoin (BTC) has the highest market capitalization, with Ethereum (ETH) accounting for 50% of it. Other cryptocurrencies have significantly lower market caps.
- Tether (USDT) has a market capitalization three times less than Ethereum.

### Price Trends

- In 2021, the value of BTC reached an all-time high of nearly $60,000, approximately 15 times more than the second-highest cryptocurrency, ETH.
- BTC, ETH, and USDT have shown growth over the last five years, benefiting investors.
- BTC and ETH have exhibited patterns of two golden crosses and two death crosses over the years, with the last crossing point being a golden cross (bullish).
- USDT has experienced numerous golden cross and death cross patterns, indicating high volatility.

## Conclusion

In summary, Bitcoin dominates the market with Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies have considerably lower market capitalizations. Tether (USDT) is relatively smaller in comparison to Ethereum.

Investment in low-cap cryptocurrencies (penny cryptocurrencies) should be approached with caution, as indicated by the volatility of USDT.

The year 2021 witnessed Bitcoin's all-time high, significantly surpassing the value of other cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum.

Both BTC and ETH have exhibited patterns of golden crosses and death crosses, with the latest crossing point being bullish. On the other hand, USDT has displayed high volatility with multiple crossing patterns.
